Laravel package that adds computed attributes to eloquent models.
A computed attribute is an accessor where the value is saved in the database.
The value can be regenerated or validated at any time.
This can increase performance (no calculation at every get/fetch) and it can simplify querying the database (f.e. complex filter system).
